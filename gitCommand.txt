    there are 4 stages 
    1. Untracked (where file is not tracked by git)
    2. Staged (after commit file goes to staged mode)
    3. Unmodified (after staged file gose to unmodified state)
    4. Modified (if any modification done then file goes to modified state, here we need to commit our chages)

git status

// to change state from untracked to staged
git add filename(with extention)

// to commit(in this state(staged) git asked us to commit our changes)
git commit

this command open vm editor where we can't write anything directly,
to write command we have to press i

to commit write -> initial commit
to exit write -> esc -> : + w + q (this line commit our changes)

// to create a blanck file
touch filename (with extention)
this file is in untracked staged

// to add all the file in staged state
git add -A

// to get back last update
git checkout filename(with extention)

// to switch one branch to another
git checkout branchname

// to get back all file to its last update which are in modified state
git checkout -f

// to display details about the last edit with editor
git log

we can specify how many log we want to display
git log -p -(value)

// to find the difference with current working tree and staged state
git diff

// to compair with last update
git diff -f

// to auto commit
git commit -a -m "skiped staging area and fixed <"

if you write any comment the write in > -m "comment"

// to remove a file 
git rm --cached filename(with extention)

this command remove the file from staged state to untrack state

git rm -f filename(with extention)

this line remove file from git and memory also

// if we want to ignore any file and folder, create a folder gitignore and write those in this folder
touch .gitignore

mention those files or folder

/index.html (specific file will be ignored)
*.css (all .css file will be ignored)
foldername/ (spcific folder will be ignored)

// In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to snapshot of your changes.

In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository

master is the parent of all branch

to create new branch > git branch branchname

// to display all branches
git branch
